# Challenge 5: PyBer Analysis
## Overview of The PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to review rideshare data for PyBer to determine affordability and improve services. The analysis organizes the data into city types: Urban, Suburban and Rural. It then visualizes total fares for each city type for the first four months of 2019.
## PyBer Analysis Results
### PyBer Summary Dataframe 
This table displays the ridesharing summary organized by city type. The data is from January 1st to May 8th 2019 (127 days).

**Key observations:**
- There are 13 times as many rides in the urban type and 5 times as many rides in the suburban type when comapred with rural city type.
- There are more drivers than rides for the urban type, this is the opposite for suburban and rural types.

### PyBer Fare Summary
This chart displays the total fares for each week by city type.

**Key observations:**
- Fares for all three types fluctuate from week to week in a range around $500 USD.
- The total weekly fares for urban is higher than suburban and suburban is higher than rural. This is most likely due to the population density differences between these three types. 
- Data for a full calendar year, or mutiple years, would be required to ascertain if there are seasonal variances or patterns.

## PyBer Analysis Summary

**Business Recommendations:**
1. Urban drivers are earning far less per ride comapred to suburban and rural drivers. Pyber may want to consider limiting the total number of urban drivers or raising the fare prices in urban areas and to lesser extent in suburban areas, and give this increase to the drivers.
2. Rural and sburban riders are paying more than urban riders. PyBer could acquire more rural and suburban drivers to increase supply which would drive down the average fare price due to increased competition.
3. There is a weekly fluctuation up to $500 USD. PyBer could introduce pricing variations by current demand to establish more consistent weekly total fare results by city type.
